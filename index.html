        <p>Hi! My name is Johann Vasquez, and I'm from Panama City, Panama. I have a deep passion for computers and
            programming, especially exploring new technologies and solving complex problems through code. Iâ€™m currently
            studying software development at BYU, and Iâ€™m constantly amazed by how much there is to learn and the
            endless possibilities technology offers.
            I'm particularly excited about web development and understanding how web pages function behind the scenes. I
            want to master building dynamic, user-friendly applications. Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating on
            projects, learning from others, and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
            My goal is to become a well-rounded developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and maybe even launch my
            own startup one day. The tech field is always evolving, and I love the challenge of keeping up with new
            advancements. Whether it's debugging code, designing interfaces, or optimizing performance, I find every
            aspect of development fascinating. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me and the impact I can make
            in the digital world!</p>

        <p>Panama City is full of lifeâ€”bright sun shines on tall buildings while fishermen work by the water. The old
            town has pretty streets, busy squares, and tasty snacks. The canal is amazing to see, and the sunset turns
            the sky orange and pink. Itâ€™s a happy, exciting place!</p>
